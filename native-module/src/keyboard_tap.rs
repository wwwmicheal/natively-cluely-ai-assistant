//! Session-wide stealth keyboard interception via CGEventTap.
//!
//! # What this is
//!
//! A CGEventTap is the macOS mechanism for sitting in the OS keyboard event
//! pipeline BEFORE events reach the foreground app. We use the session-level
//! tap (`kCGSessionEventTap`) so we see every keystroke routed through the
//! login session, regardless of which app would otherwise receive it. While
//! the tap is active, our callback decides whether to swallow each event
//! (return null → event is destroyed and never delivered) or pass it through
//! (return the event → normal delivery).
//!
//! # Why we want this on top of NSPanel-nonactivating
//!
//! NSPanel + becomesKeyOnlyIfNeeded already prevents Natively from activating
//! the app when buttons are clicked or the input is focused. But for keystrokes
//! to reach our text input via the normal DOM pipeline, the panel still has to
//! become the OS-level "key window" — which causes a window-level focus shift
//! that some screen-share / focus-follower tools can detect. With CGEventTap,
//! Natively NEVER becomes the key window for keyboard input. The user's Zoom
//! call stays the key window of the frontmost app; we silently siphon
//! keystrokes off the wire and present them in the renderer.
//!
//! # Activation model
//!
//! The tap is opt-in per session. Caller pattern:
//!
//!   1. User presses an activation hotkey (handled at the JS layer via
//!      globalShortcut, which fires before the session event tap so the
//!      hotkey itself is consumed by Carbon and not seen by us).
//!   2. JS calls `StealthKeyboardTap.start(callback)` to engage the tap.
//!   3. Every key event fires the callback with `{keyCode, chars, flags,
//!      isKeyDown}`. The event is SWALLOWED — the foreground app does not
//!      receive it.
//!   4. JS calls `stop()` to disengage (typically on Esc, hotkey-again, or
//!      blur-by-mouse).
//!
//! Swallowing is unconditional while the tap is active. Pass-through mode
//! defeats the purpose (foreground app would still receive everything; this
//! would just be a keylogger). Simpler and safer to gate the tap's lifetime
//! at the JS layer than to negotiate per-event suppression.
//!
//! # Permission requirements
//!
//! `CGEventTapCreate` returns NULL unless the process has Accessibility
//! trust (System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility). On first
//! `start()` without permission, we surface a `false` return; the caller
//! should invoke `request_accessibility_permission()` to show the system
//! prompt. After the user grants in System Settings, the app must be
//! restarted (macOS does not retroactively grant tap rights to a running
//! process).
//!
//! # Threading
//!
//! `CFRunLoopRun` blocks the calling thread. We spawn a dedicated worker
//! thread, create the tap inside it, attach to that thread's runloop, and
//! block on `CFRunLoopRun()` until `stop()` is called. `stop()` calls
//! `CFRunLoopStop` from the main thread (CFRunLoop is documented as
//! thread-safe for stop), the worker thread unblocks, releases the tap,
//! and exits.
//!
//! Callbacks land on the worker thread; we use napi-rs's
//! `ThreadsafeFunction` to marshal each captured event back to V8.
