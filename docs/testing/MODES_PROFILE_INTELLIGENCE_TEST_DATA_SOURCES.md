# Modes & Profile Intelligence — Test Data Sources

Every reference fixture used by this suite is recorded here with its source classification, sentinel facts, expected retrieval behaviour, and expected answer behaviour.

Three source types are used:

* `downloaded_public` — file fetched from a public, legally-accessible URL. Only used when the downloader runs (`RUN_INTERNET_FIXTURE_COLLECTION=1`). All such files are cached under `tests/fixtures/internet-sourced/` along with metadata JSON.
* `generated_from_public_template` — content inspired by public template structure (e.g. a standard "sales call script" outline), but with synthetic facts so we own the IP and can place deterministic sentinels.
* `synthetic_fallback` — wholly invented for sentinel-bearing assertions. Used by default in CI so tests do not depend on the internet.

In CI the suite uses `synthetic_fallback` content unless `RUN_INTERNET_FIXTURE_COLLECTION=1` is set. The downloader is implemented at `tests/utils/internetFixtureCollector.ts` and is invoked only by `npm run test:modes:collect-fixtures` (added to package.json scripts in this PR).

## Internet collector

Implementation: `tests/utils/internetFixtureCollector.ts`. Behaviour:

* Only fetches `https://` URLs with allow-listed hosts (Wikipedia, github.com raw, ietf.org, w3.org).
* Max file size: 1 MiB.
* Allowed extensions: `.txt`, `.md`, `.json`, `.csv`, `.xml`, `.html`.
* Filenames sanitized (`[^a-zA-Z0-9._-]` → `_`).
* Metadata JSON sidecar (`FixtureSourceMetadata`) written next to every cached file.
* If a fetch fails or the host is blocked, the collector falls back to the synthetic fixture and marks `sourceType: 'synthetic_fallback'`.

The collector is **not** invoked from default test runs. It is documented and shipped so that operators can opt in.

## Adding new fixtures

1. Drop the file under `tests/fixtures/modes/<mode>/`.
2. Add a row to the table above.
3. Add at least one sentinel sentence to the file content.
4. If the file should be retrieved by a specific test, ensure the sentinel word(s) overlap by ≥1 stemmed token with the test query (the lexical retriever uses a Jaccard-style score with a 0.18 minimum).
